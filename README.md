## Optimizing-Clustering-Metrics-for-Patient-Stratification
_This project was part of my MSc2 internship, which lasted 5.5 months at the Institute for Cancer Research, Oslo University Hospital, Norway._
<p align='justify'>With the advancement of personalized medicine, integrating survival analysis with clustering techniques and multi-modal data has emerged as a promising avenue for identifying patient subgroups with distinct prognostic characteristics. However, the computational complexity of finding an optimal patient stratification that maximizes the difference in survival outcomes, even in cases with two groups, poses a significant challenge. This is a master's internship project that aims to address this challenge by developing and implementing heuristic approaches tailored to optimize patient clustering based solely on survival information. The primary objective is to leverage heuristic algorithms to identify a partition that maximizes relevant metrics such as the log-rank statistic, thereby offering valuable insights into patient stratification and prognosis. Furthermore, this methodology will facilitate the establishment of an adjusted statistical score for assessing the performance of clustering models, enabling more interpretable benchmarking against a heuristic-driven optimal maximum value.</p>
